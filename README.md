# **Butter Dish Case**  for DIY Slime VR
## The Butter Dish Case was designed to fit the [BreakoutSlime PCB](https://github.com/TheButlah/slimevr_pcb/tree/main/hardware/breakout_slime) <br> Designed by: [TheButlah](https://github.com/TheButlah)

All the parts were designed with FDM 3D-Printing in mind.
The case has a snap-fitting lid design that snaps into place without the need for any screws or adhesive.
The case also has a cutout for a 5 pin male JST XH connector, USB Type-C for the TP-4056 Charging module, and USB Micro Type-B for the Wemos D1 Mini.

 Soldering is straight forward. Follow the standard soldering procedures, and use the headerpins to mount the components correctly so that they will be alligned with the cutouts.


## Assembly

After successfully soldering the PCB, and confirming that it's working properly, place the Battery in the case and secure it via double sided adhesive tape. Make sure to insulate the battery using electrical tape before continuing with the next step. Connect the female 2 pin JST-XH on the battery to the pcb, and secure the pcb using double sided adhesive onto the insulated battery.
